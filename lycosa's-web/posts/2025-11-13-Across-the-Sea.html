              <p style="color: #005682;"><b>I've been feeling a bit more.... Longing???? I dunno why or how, but its like I'm reaching for something I can't even see or grasp. Not necessarily in a bad way, though. Kinda like a yearning. Yearning is a really fucked-up feeling, especially when you have not a thought in your head about what you yearn for. Love???? Idk.</b></p>
